For the interactive component, we examine how shooting patterns vary with shooting distance among all players and compare the shooting patterns in different periods.

By looking at all data, we obtain the same conclusion as before, which is that players shoot less mid-range than 3-points and layups.

After exploring the patterns with different periods, we find that shooting patterns mentioned above vary slightly with periods and by looking at plots in first quarter and second quarter carefuly, one difference we should notice is that players tend to make less long-distanced shots after the first quarter because we have seen a drop on all shots made 23 feet away from the basketball in the second quarter. So all teams should be alerted in second quarter and focus on the defense in the painted area.
