# Introduction

Basketball is a team sport in which the goal is to try to outscore the amount in a fixed amount of time. Points are scored (either 2 or 3 points) by putting the ball throw a hoop on one end of the court. An attempt at putting the ball throw the hoop is known as a "shot". If helpful, here are rules of basketball: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_basketball.

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the professional basketball league in the United States and provides a nice website with many statistics gathered on teams and players in the league: https://www.nba.com/stats/.

As one of the most popular athletic leagues, NBA attracts elite players and these players represent the highest level of basketball in the world. However, the shooting behavior varies from player to player and even team to team. Therefore, intrigued by a passion for basketball and the abundance of data resources on the NBA website, we decided to implore the pattern of shooting behaviors in NBA for our final project and hope to take a small glance on what we are curious about through exploratory data analysis and visualization.

We propose the following questions to answer:

1. (On league level)

2. (On team level)
What are some differences between shooting behaviors preferences for each team? Does the preference change period by period? Does the preference corresponds to field goal percentage?

3. (On individual player level)
Whether Russ Westbrook (Guard) has different shooting behavior (the shooting count and shot probability on different areas on the field) in different periods of the game? What about LeBron James (Forward)? Is LeBron’s shooting behavior similar to Russ ’s in different periods of the game?
