# Introduction

Basketball is a team sport in which the goal is to try to outscore the amount in a fixed amount of time. Points are scored (either 2 or 3 points) by putting the ball throw a hoop on one end of the court. An attempt at putting the ball throw the hoop is known as a "shot". If helpful, here are rules of basketball: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_basketball.

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the professional basketball league in the United States and provides a nice website with many statistics gathered on teams and players in the league: https://www.nba.com/stats/.

Intrigued by a passion for basketball and the abundance of data resources on the NBA website, we picked up this topic for our final project and hope to take a small glance on what we are curious about through exploratory data analysis and visualization.

We propose the following questions to answer:

1. (On general player and team level)
What is the distribution of the total number of shots made for all players in the entire season? What about shot probability? Is there any difference between shots attempted and goaled for different teams in different zones? What about differences between the home team and visiting team?

2. (On individual player level)
Whether Russ Westbrook (Guard) has different shooting behavior (the shooting count and shot probability on different areas on the field) in different periods of the game? What about LeBron James (Forward)? Is LeBron’s shooting behavior similar to Russ ’s in different periods of the game?
