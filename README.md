For this EDAV project, we are going to focus on the shooting behaviors of NBA players and analyze the impact of shooting behaviors on the performance of players and teams. 

## Three perspectives to approach the result

### General Player and Team Level

- [ ] 1. What is the distribution of the total number of shots made for all players in the entire season?

- [ ] 2. Is there any difference between shots attempted and goaled for different teams in different zones?


### Individual Player Level

- [ ] 1. Whether Russ Westbrook (Guard) has different shooting behavior (the shooting count and shot probability on different areas on the field) in different periods of the game?

- [ ] 2. Is LeBron’s shooting behavior similar to Russ ’s in different periods of the game?


### Historical level

- [ ] 1. Are players shooting more 3s nowadays? Are players shooting farther away from the basket?

- [ ] 2. Is there an obvious trend for each team’s performance?




## Data Resources

Note that there is no downloading option for the data on NBA Official Website, so we need to use a repository and GET requests to scrape data from the NBA API - https://github.com/swar/nba_api. 

This API is considered a reliable source for the NBA data because the link was created to http://stats.nba.com/stats/shotchartdetail, which is the official website for NBA statistics.


(This repo was initially generated from a bookdown template available here: https://github.com/jtr13/EDAVtemplate.)
