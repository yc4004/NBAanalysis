# Data transformation

```{r load_library} 
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
```


```{r load_data}
shot_data = read_csv("shotchartdetail.csv")
```


## Detailed shots data
For the detailed shots data, there are some categorical data which should be as factor with levels. For example, for `shot_zone_range` feature, the level of category should be "Less Than 8 ft.", "8-16 ft.", "16-24 ft.", "24+ ft.", and "Back Court Shot" based on the distance from the basket.

```{r}
shot_data <- shot_data %>%
  mutate(shot_zone_range = factor(shot_zone_range, levels = c("Less Than 8 ft.", "8-16 ft.", "16-24 ft.","24+ ft.","Back Court Shot"))) 
```
