# Conclusion

## Concluding the Findings

From our analysis in chapter 5, we conclude our findings from the shooting pattern for NBA Season 2020-21 as follows:

1. On general league level, nowadays, the basketball tends to shoot less mid-range shots - either shoot close to basket or making more 3-point shots - to try to maximize points per play. Our hypothesis shows that the field goal percentage (whether the goal made succesully or not) is related to the shooting distance. 

2. Teams vary significantly on their choice for making 2-point or 3-point shots. This preference also differs period by period. As the game approaches to 4th period, teams tend to make more 3-point shots compared to their performance in 1st period. In addition, there is no clear relation between the FG% and the team's preference for making 2-point or 3-point shots.
