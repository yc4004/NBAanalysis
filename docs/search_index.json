After getting the data out, here we firstly have a look at the head of data: Table continues below grid_type game_id game_event_id player_id player_name Shot Chart Detail 0021900001 7 1628366 Lonzo Ball Shot Chart Detail 0021900001 9 202324 Derrick Favors Shot Chart Detail 0021900001 10 1628384 OG Anunoby Table continues below team_id team_name period minutes_remaining 1610612740 New Orleans Pelicans 1 11 1610612740 New Orleans Pelicans 1 11 1610612761 Toronto Raptors 1 11 Table continues below seconds_remaining event_type action_type shot_type 48 Missed Shot Driving Floating Jump Shot 2PT Field Goal 47 Made Shot Tip Layup Shot 2PT Field Goal 29 Missed Shot Driving Layup Shot 2PT Field Goal Table continues below shot_zone_basic shot_zone_area shot_zone_range shot_distance In The Paint (Non-RA) Center(C) 8-16 ft. 11 Restricted Area Center(C) Less Than 8 ft. 0 Restricted Area Center(C) Less Than 8 ft. 3 loc_x loc_y shot_attempted_flag shot_made_flag game_date htm vtm 2 114 1 0 20191022 TOR NOP 0 -6 1 1 20191022 TOR NOP 15 28 1 0 20191022 TOR NOP It seems that there is actually no missing values in our first 5 rows of data. To examine the whole dataset, we firstly count the total number of missing value: value 0 To further confirm our hypothesis that our dataset contains no missing data, we then draw a missing value plot: From the plot, we can see that all rows are “completed cases”, and the total number of missing values for each variable is 0. As expected, both results indicates that our dataset contains no missing data. Therefore, we can finally conclude that there is no missing data in our dataset.
