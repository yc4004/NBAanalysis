[["index.html", "NBA Analysis Chapter 1 Introduction", " NBA Analysis Anne Lin, Yanbing Chen 2021-12-10 Chapter 1 Introduction Basketball is a team sport in which the goal is to try to outscore the amount in a fixed amount of time. Points are scored (either 2 or 3 points) by putting the ball throw a hoop on one end of the court. An attempt at putting the ball throw the hoop is known as a “shot”. If helpful, here are rules of basketball: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_basketball. The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the professional basketball league in the United States and provides a nice website with many statistics gathered on teams and players in the league: https://www.nba.com/stats/. As one of the most popular athletic leagues, NBA attracts elite players and these palyers represent the highest level of basketball in the world. However, the shooting behavior varies from player to player so intrigued by a passion for basketball and the abundance of data resources on the NBA website, we decided to implore the pattern of shooting behavaiors in NBA for our final project and hope to take a small glance on what we are curious about through exploratory data analysis and visualization. We propose the following questions to answer: (On general player and team level) What is the distribution of the total number of shots made for all players in the entire season? What about shot probability? Is there any difference between shots attempted and goaled for different teams in different zones? What about differences between the home team and visiting team? (On individual player level) Whether Russ Westbrook (Guard) has different shooting behavior (the shooting count and shot probability on different areas on the field) in different periods of the game? What about LeBron James (Forward)? Is LeBron’s shooting behavior similar to Russ ’s in different periods of the game? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Detailed shots data", " Chapter 2 Data sources Note that there is no downloading option for the data on NBA official website, so we need to scrape the data from the official website https://www.nba.com/stats/ using GET() from httr library. Since the data source is the NBA official website, it is considered reliable. 2.1 Detailed shots data The scraping procedure for detailed shots data for 2020-21 Regular Season is as follows: For the detailed shooting data, we firstly land in the https://www.nba.com/stats/ webpage. Scrolling down, we can see a “Shotchart Search” section. Inputting one player’s name, taking Stephen Curry during 2021-22 season as example, we can land in the page https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?flag=3&amp;CFID=33&amp;CFPARAMS=2021-22&amp;PlayerID=201939&amp;ContextMeasure=FGA&amp;Season=2021-22&amp;section=player&amp;sct=hex. In this page, we can see data with each row being a field goal that gives us information like the type of shot, whether it was successful, shot distance, etc. However, the exact location of the shot doesn’t appear. To access the detailed shots location data, we can right click on the webpage and select “Inspect” and navigate to the “Network” tab. Then we can find the shotchartdetail data (if not appear, refresh page). Once find it, right clicking it and open it in a new tab, so we can get the URL. After getting the URL, we can use the url to import the data on the webpage into our R studio using GET() function. After building the function to grab shots data using GET() and doing simple data preprocessing, our final shot data contains in total 24 columns and around 200,000 observations. The variables include player information (ID, name), team information (ID, name), game information (ID, date), and shot information (period, minutes and seconds remaining, whether shot successful, XY location, shot zone, shot area, etc.) All variables are in either string or integer format except date. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Detailed shots data", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Detailed shots data For the detailed shots data, there are some categorical data which should be as factor with levels. For example, for shot_zone_range feature, the level of category should be “Less Than 8 ft.”, “8-16 ft.”, “16-24 ft.”, “24+ ft.”, and “Back Court Shot” based on the distance from the basket. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing Values 4.1 Detailed shots data", " Chapter 4 Missing Values 4.1 Detailed shots data We will look at the missing pattern of detailed shots data for NBA Regular Season 2020-21. After getting the data out in the data sources portion, here we firstly have a look at the head of data: Table continues below grid_type game_id game_event_id player_id player_name Shot Chart Detail 0022000001 12 202681 Kyrie Irving Shot Chart Detail 0022000001 13 1630164 James Wiseman Shot Chart Detail 0022000001 16 201142 Kevin Durant Table continues below team_id team_name period minutes_remaining 1.611e+09 Brooklyn Nets 1 11 1.611e+09 Golden State Warriors 1 11 1.611e+09 Brooklyn Nets 1 10 Table continues below seconds_remaining event_type action_type shot_type 22 Made Shot Pullup Jump shot 2PT Field Goal 11 Made Shot Cutting Dunk Shot 2PT Field Goal 49 Made Shot Pullup Jump shot 3PT Field Goal Table continues below shot_zone_basic shot_zone_area shot_zone_range shot_distance loc_x Mid-Range Center(C) 16-24 ft. 22 -2 Restricted Area Center(C) Less Than 8 ft. 0 9 Above the Break 3 Center(C) 24+ ft. 25 -20 loc_y shot_attempted_flag shot_made_flag game_date htm vtm 220 1 1 20201222 BKN GSW -2 1 1 20201222 BKN GSW 258 1 1 20201222 BKN GSW It seems that there is actually no missing values in our first 5 rows of data. To examine the whole dataset, we firstly count the total number of missing value: value 0 To further confirm our hypothesis that our dataset contains no missing data, we then draw a missing value plot: From the plot, we can see that all rows are “completed cases”, and the total number of missing values for each variable is 0. As expected, both results indicates that our dataset contains no missing data. Therefore, we can finally conclude that there is no missing data in our datase and proceed to next steps.

Here are our questions proposed in the introduction chapter: (On general player and team level) What is the distribution of the total number of shots made for all players in the entire season? What about shot probability? Is there any difference between shots attempted and goaled for different teams in different zones? What about differences between the home team and visiting team?

What about LeBron James (Forward)? Is LeBron’s shooting behavior similar to Russ ’s in different periods of the game? Note that in the following analysis, we need to plot the NBA court to visualize the shooting data. The code for drawing the court is adapted from https://github.com/toddwschneider/ballr, and the court graph is as follows: 5.1 Team Analysis 5.2 Individual Player Analysis Here we will specially explore "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
