[["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion Concluding the Findings From our analysis in chapter 5, we conclude our findings from the shooting pattern for NBA Season 2020-21 as follows: On general league level, nowadays, the basketball tends to shoot less mid-range shots - either shoot close to basket or making more 3-point shots - to try to maximize points per play. Our hypothesis shows that the field goal percentage (whether the goal made succesully or not) is related to the shooting distance. Teams vary significantly on their choice for making 2-point or 3-point shots. This preference also differs period by period. As the game approaches to 4th period, teams tend to make more 3-point shots compared to their performance in 1st period. In addition, there is no clear relation between the FG% and the team’s preference for making 2-point or 3-point shots. Players has different personalities in shooting behavior. Stephen Curry’s shooting behavior is a classical example of modern basketball: try less on mid-range shot and more 2-point shots near hoop and 3-point shots, and his filed goals are mostly above league average. Stephen Curry’s weakness is left corner three. LeBron James did fantastic in the paint (near hoop), and he tried a lot mid range shots and threes but the results was not ideal. His shooting percentage on the left corner is extremely high, where by chance Stephen Curry was not good at. Comparing Playoffs to Regular Season, LeBron James still did better than average near hoop, but his shooting significantly declined in that area. Giannis Antetokounmpo in this season spent most his attempts on 2-point shots and 2/3 of his shots happened less than 8 feet away from the basket, and he approached the rim more often from the left although he is right-handed. Discussing Limitations Although we discussed shooting behaviors on different levels from broad to detail (from league to team and to player), we only focused on the shot features - such as shot time, location, distance, etc. - made by each team and player without other information. However, there are still other considerations. For example, in determining the shooting behaviors of a player, the player demographics (height, weight, etc.) and the position he plays (guard or forward) can also affect the player’s shooting behavior. Also, other considerations such as the defender’s distance from the player can also affect the player’s shots. In determining the shooting behaviors of a team, it may be heavily relied on the kinds of players in that team and the experience and preference of the coach. These are all aspects that we haven’t included in our project when determining the shooting behaviors. Looking Into the Future With the more advanced visualization tools, analyzing shooting behavior of a team or player becomes easier, and we are able to explore more underlying insights through using different ways to visualize the numbers. Considering the limitations we discussed before, there are a wide array of aspects to analyze the NBA shooting data and interpreting strategies of a team or a player. With more NBA data been utilized, we look forward that Exploratory Data Analysis on NBA data may in the future help players or teams to see their weaknesses more easily and make improvement, and even find the opponent weaknesses to improve defence.
