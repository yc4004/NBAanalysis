After getting the data out in the data sources portion, here we firstly have a look at the head of data: Table continues below grid_type game_id game_event_id player_id player_name Shot Chart Detail 0022000001 12 202681 Kyrie Irving Shot Chart Detail 0022000001 13 1630164 James Wiseman Shot Chart Detail 0022000001 16 201142 Kevin Durant Table continues below team_id team_name period minutes_remaining 1.611e+09 Brooklyn Nets 1 11 1.611e+09 Golden State Warriors 1 11 1.611e+09 Brooklyn Nets 1 10 Table continues below seconds_remaining event_type action_type shot_type 22 Made Shot Pullup Jump shot 2PT Field Goal 11 Made Shot Cutting Dunk Shot 2PT Field Goal 49 Made Shot Pullup Jump shot 3PT Field Goal Table continues below shot_zone_basic shot_zone_area shot_zone_range shot_distance loc_x Mid-Range Center(C) 16-24 ft. 22 -2 Restricted Area Center(C) Less Than 8 ft. 0 9 Above the Break 3 Center(C) 24+ ft. 25 -20 loc_y shot_attempted_flag shot_made_flag game_date htm vtm 220 1 1 20201222 BKN GSW -2 1 1 20201222 BKN GSW 258 1 1 20201222 BKN GSW It seems that there is actually no missing values in our first 5 rows of data. To examine the whole dataset, we firstly count the total number of missing value: value 0 To further confirm our hypothesis that our dataset contains no missing data, we then draw a missing value plot: From the plot, we can see that all rows are “completed cases”, and the total number of missing values for each variable is 0. As expected, both results indicates that our dataset contains no missing data. Therefore, we can finally conclude that there is no missing data in our datase and proceed to next steps.
