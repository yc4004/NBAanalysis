Points are scored (either 2 or 3 points) by putting the ball throw a hoop on one end of the court. An attempt at putting the ball throw the hoop is known as a “shot”. If helpful, here are rules of basketball: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_basketball. The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the professional basketball league in the United States and provides a nice website with many statistics gathered on teams and players in the league: https://www.nba.com/stats/. As one of the most popular athletic leagues, NBA attracts elite players and these players represent the highest level of basketball in the world. However, the shooting behavior varies from player to player and even team to team. Therefore, intrigued by a passion for basketball and the abundance of data resources on the NBA website, we decided to implore the pattern of shooting behaviors in NBA for our final project and hope to take a small glance on what we are curious about through exploratory data analysis and visualization. We propose the following questions to answer: (On League Level) We will give a overall glance at the dataset of last season to have a basic understanding on the league’s shooting behaviors. (On Team Level) Basketball is a team-played game and each team has its own style and culture. From the perspective of team, we are going to look for some differences between shooting behaviors preferences and learn the relationship between the shooting patterns and period, field goal percentage, etc. (On Player Level) We choose three most popular players, Stephen Curry, Lebron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo to investigate their shooting choices and look at how other variables could influence their shooting decision such as in differnet periods of game. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Note that there is no downloading option for the data on NBA official website, so we need to scrape the data from the official website https://www.nba.com/stats/ using GET() from httr library. Since the data source is the NBA official website, and we scraped the data directly from it, it is considered reliable. In this project we want to focus on the data for the last regular season and playoffs, meaning the 2020-21 Regular Season and Playoffs. 2020-21 Regular Season Shots Data The scraping procedure for detailed shots data for 2020-21 Regular Season is as follows: For the detailed shooting data, we firstly land in the https://www.nba.com/stats/ webpage. Scrolling down, we can see a “Shotchart Search” section. Inputting one player’s name, taking Stephen Curry during 2021-22 season as example, we can land in the page https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?flag=3&amp;CFID=33&amp;CFPARAMS=2021-22&amp;PlayerID=201939&amp;ContextMeasure=FGA&amp;Season=2021-22&amp;section=player&amp;sct=hex. In this page, we can see data with each row being a field goal that gives us information like the type of shot, whether it was successful, shot distance, etc. However, the exact location of the shot doesn’t appear. To access the detailed shots location data, we can right click on the webpage and select “Inspect” and navigate to the “Network” tab. Then we can find the shotchartdetail data (if not appear, refresh page). Once find it, right clicking it and open it in a new tab, so we can get the URL. After getting the URL, we can use the url to import the data on the webpage into our R studio using GET() function. After building the function to grab shots data using GET() and doing simple data preprocessing, our final 2020-21 Regular Season Shots Data contains in total 24 columns and around 200,000 observations. The variables include player information (ID, name), team information (ID, name), game information (ID, date), and shot information (period, minutes and seconds remaining, whether shot successful, XY location, shot zone, shot area, etc.). All variables are in either string or integer format except date. 2020-21 Playoffs Shots Data Using a similar way, we can get the detailed shots data for Playoffs. Our 2020-21 Playoffs Shots Data contain a total of 14771 observations, and the same variables as the 2020-21 Regular Season Shots Data. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Here we will perform some small modifications to our dataset to make it more easy to manipulate: The first column indicates the dataset type, which is ``Shot Chart Detail” for all rows, so we choose to remove it. shot_data &lt;- shot_data %&gt;% select(-grid_type) period column should be ordinal factors rather than numbers. shot_data &lt;- shot_data %&gt;% mutate(period = factor(period, levels = c(&quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;3&quot;,&quot;4&quot;,&quot;5&quot;,&quot;6&quot;))) 3.shot_zone_range column should be ordinal factors with the levels ordered by the distance from the basket. shot_data &lt;- shot_data %&gt;% mutate(shot_zone_range = factor(shot_zone_range, levels = c(&quot;Less Than 8 ft.&quot;, &quot;8-16 ft.&quot;, &quot;16-24 ft.&quot;,&quot;24+ ft.&quot;,&quot;Back Court Shot&quot;))) game_date column should be dates rather than numbers. shot_data$game_date &lt;- as.Date(as.character(shot_data$game_date), format=&quot;%Y%m%d&quot;) After all the above steps, we would get a data frame that’s ready for exploration. Since the data contains a great number of variables, we would determine which ones we would apply for step by step during our process of exploratory data analysis and visualization. So far, our idea is not to remove variables or missing values beforehand, in order to keep the completeness of the data frame. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing Values", " Chapter 4 Missing Values We will look at the missing pattern of detailed shots data for NBA 2020-21 Regular Season and Playoffs. 2020-21 Regular Season Shots Data After getting the data out in the data sources portion, here we firstly have a look at the head of the NBA 2020-21 Regular Season data: Table continues below grid_type game_id game_event_id player_id player_name Shot Chart Detail 0022000001 12 202681 Kyrie Irving Shot Chart Detail 0022000001 13 1630164 James Wiseman Shot Chart Detail 0022000001 16 201142 Kevin Durant Table continues below team_id team_name period minutes_remaining 1.611e+09 Brooklyn Nets 1 11 1.611e+09 Golden State Warriors 1 11 1.611e+09 Brooklyn Nets 1 10 Table continues below seconds_remaining event_type action_type shot_type 22 Made Shot Pullup Jump shot 2PT Field Goal 11 Made Shot Cutting Dunk Shot 2PT Field Goal 49 Made Shot Pullup Jump shot 3PT Field Goal Table continues below shot_zone_basic shot_zone_area shot_zone_range shot_distance loc_x Mid-Range Center(C) 16-24 ft. 22 -2 Restricted Area Center(C) Less Than 8 ft. 0 9 Above the Break 3 Center(C) 24+ ft. 25 -20 loc_y shot_attempted_flag shot_made_flag game_date htm vtm 220 1 1 20201222 BKN GSW -2 1 1 20201222 BKN GSW 258 1 1 20201222 BKN GSW It seems that there is actually no missing values in our first 5 rows of data. To examine the whole dataset, we firstly count the total number of missing value: value 0 To further confirm our hypothesis that our dataset contains no missing data, we then draw a missing value plot: From the plot, we can see that all rows are “completed cases”, and the total number of missing values for each variable is 0, suggesting that there is no missing data. 2020-21 Playoffs Shots Data Since there is no missing data in regular season, we would expect that there is also no missing data in playoffs. Firstly, we check the total number of missing data: value 0 Now we plot the missing value plot: From the plot, similar as before, we can see that all rows are “completed cases”, and the total number of missing values for each variable is 0. Therefore, as expected, our results indicates that both of our dataset for regular season and playoffs contain no missing data. Therefore, we can finally conclude that there is no missing data in our datasets and proceed to next steps. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 League Shooting Pattern Analysis 5.2 Team Shooting Pattern Analysis 5.3 Individual Player Analysis", " Chapter 5 Results In this chapter, we will proceed to come up with the answers and our conclusions to each of the questions we proposed in the introduction section. Here are our questions proposed in the introduction chapter: (On League Level) We will give a overall glance at the dataset for the entire league of last season to have a basic understanding on the shooting behaviors. (On Team Level) Basketball is a team-played game and each team has its own style and culture. From the perspective of team, we are going to look for some differences between shooting behaviors preferences and learn the relationship between the shooting patterns and period, field goal percentage, etc. (On Player Level) Sometimes a single player could make huge impact on games. We choose three most popular players, Stephen Curry, Lebron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo to investigate their shooting choices and look at how other variables could influence their shooting decision such as in different periods of game. 5.1 League Shooting Pattern Analysis 5.1.1 Distribution of Shot Distance From the first density histogram, we can see that the distribution of shot distance has two apparent peaks. Most shots are made around distance of 0 inch and 25 inches. According to the Ridgeline Plots, we can conclude that the shots made around 0 inch distance are mainly in the restricted area, and the shots made around 25 inch distance are all kinds of 3-point shots. This graph shows that the modern basketball tends to shoot less mid-range - either shoot close to basket or making more 3-point shots - to try to maximize points per play. Taking a look at the last boxplot with the distribution of shot distance according to shot result, it is obvious that missed shots have more outliers with larger distance. This situation makes sense because it is harder to make a long-distanced shot comparing to a short-distanced one. 5.1.2 Relationship between Shot Result and Shot Distance Since in previous part we realized that missed shots has more outliers with larger distance, we want to explore whether the shot distance will affect whether the shot is successfully made. From the mosaic plot, we can see that as the shot distance increase, less shots are successfully made and more shots are missed.To further confirm our hypothesis that shot distance will affect the shot result, we perform chi-square tests to test for associations between the shot distance and shot result. Null Hypothesis: Shot Distance and Shot Result are independent. Alternative Hypothesis: Shot Distance and Shot Result are NOT independent. Pearson’s Chi-squared test: shot_dis_mos_mtx Test statistic df P value 7675 4 0 * * * Since the p-value is less than 0.01, meaning the probability of us accepting the null hypothesis is less than 1%, so we can reject null hypothesis that Shot Distance and Shot Result are independent. Therefore, it means that there is relation between Shot Distance and Shot Result. 5.1.3 Shot Attempted in Different Periods Every NBA game has four regular periods to decide which team is winner (there would over time periods if score is tied), we want to see generally how well all players shoot in different periods. As shown in the second bar plots above, for both 2-point and 3-point shots, the field goal percentage stays similar for each period because the colored area of Made Shot and Missed Shot stays similar for all period. For 2-point shots the shot result approximately account for 50% of area respectively, but for the 3-point field goals, Made Shot is less than it for 2-point shots, which make sense because making 3-point shots is more difficult than making 2-point shots as we discussed in previous section that distance affects the shooting result. Also, we can see that for 2-point shots, the total shots decreases as period increases. This is a normal phenomenon to us because players would be too exhausted to shoot near hoop when the game approaching to the end. Generally spealing, this overall situation for the entire league performance is as expected. 5.2 Team Shooting Pattern Analysis At next step, we would go deeper onto the shooting performance on team level. 5.2.1 Total Shots for Each Team Although in previous section, we realized that there is no striking difference in total number and FG% for 2-point and 3-point shots in each period for the entire league, we somewhat expect this shooting pattern to differ team by team. Firstly, to get a general understanding of how many 2-point and 3-point shots each team attempted for season 2020-21, we create a Cleveland Dot Plot as follows: From the Cleveland Dot Plot, we can see that the total shots made by each team for the entire season doesn’t vary a lot, ranging from around 6000 to 6500. However, for different teams, they have different preference for 2-point shots and 3-point shots. For example, Utah Jazz has almost same counts for 2-point shots and 3-point shots with the most 3-point shots in the league. On the contrary, San Antonio Spurs has least count of 3-point shots and most count of 2-point shots in the league. Therefore, we can conclude that teams vary significantly on their choice for making 2-point or 3-point shots. 5.2.2 Three-point Preference by Period After generally seeing the preference of different teams, now we can explore the movement of preference for 2-point shots and 3-point shots period by period. To see the preference change, here we calculate the percentage of 3-point shots among all shots made in each period for each team (\\(\\text{percentage} = \\frac{\\text{3-point shots attempted}}{\\text{all shots attempted}}\\)). If the percentage increase, it means that the team prefer to make more 3-point shots. (Here Each color represents one team. The percentage represent the percentage of 3-point shots of total number of shots attempted each period. The first axis means 1st period, and so on.) From the graph we can see that, indeed, most of the teams will have different preference for 2-point and 3-point shots regarding to different periods of a game. For example, Brooklyn Nets experienced largest change in the percentage of 3-point shots among other teams: at 1st period, it has percentage between 40% and 35%, and during the 2nd period, the percentage decreased to 35% - 40%. Then during 3rd period, the percentage increased to 40%-45% and finally reached 45%-50% at the 4th period. A general trend is that, as the game approaches to 4th period, teams tend to make more 3-point shots compared to their performance in 1st period. 5.2.3 Field Goal Percentage After getting a general understanding of types and shots attempted for each team, now we want to focus on the Field Goal Percentage (\\(\\frac{\\text{ total shots made}}{\\text{total shots attempted}}\\)). Here we will use diverging bar chart to compare the Field Goal % for 2-point and 3-point shots for each team, ordering by Field Goal % for 3-point shots: From the plot, we can see that, generally, 3-point Field Goal is less than 2-point Field Goal, which makes sense because 3-point shots are harder to score regarding to the distance. It is difficult to see if the FG% for 2-point or 3-point corresponds to the team’s preference. Based on our previous conclusion, Utah Jazz has the most number of 3-point shots attempted, and San Antonio Spurs were concluded as the team least preferring 3-point shots. However, the FG% for 3-point shots are not highest for Utah Jazz and not lowest for San Antonio Spurs. This situation may be affected by the fact that, since the team prefer 3-point shots, they make more, and they miss more, so the FG% will not be the highest. Therefore, teams with more three attempts can try to put more effort into the three-point practive so that the scores could be maximized. 5.3 Individual Player Analysis After analyzing performance of teams, we would like to get deeper to individual palyer. Since there are over 300 players in the league, we are not able to analyze each player one by one so it is necessary to focus on the most brilliant stars. 5.3.1 Shooting Behavior of Stephen Curry Since in Part 5.1 we discovered that the league now generally prefer making either 2-point shots near hoop or 3-point shots with less mid-range shots, here we firstly explore the shooting behavior of Stephen Curry. As a ground-breaking player, Stephen Curry showed the world how explosive his scoring ability was and he is making a NBA record of three pointers made while this project is getting done. Analyzing his shooting behavior would be a great angle to start. These two plots use a graph of basketball court to visualize the performance of Stephen Curry at each point on the court and it divides the court to multiple zones. The color in the left graph indicate the total number of shots made by Stephen Curry, the color in the right graph indicates the field goal percentage of Stephen Curry in that specific zone comparing to the average level of the league. It is red if the player shoots above the league average and blue if lower than league average. In the plot above, we could first notice that Stephen Curry tries most of his shots in the paint (a rectangle area nearest to the basket) and out of three-point line. Again, this shooting behavior is a classical example of modern basketball: try less on mid-range shot. Another characteristic of his shooting is the range of his threes. We could even see multiple hexagons even 7 feet further away from the three-point line, which makes it harder to guard him. On the other hand, we could still see that Stephen has his weakness, which is left corner. His left-corner threes are deep blue so it would be a great strategy to limit him to shoot at that place. However, I think he is able to develope becasue he shoots very well on the other corner. 5.3.2 Shooting pattern in playoffs of LeBron James We could always say that games of regular season do not really matter because being a championship depends on the performance in playoffs. So many top players choose to take as many rest as they can in regular season so that they could save more energy for the playoffs. Therefore, it would be great if we can find some differences of shooting behavior in regular season and playoffs. As a die-hard Lakers fan, I would choose to analyze LeBron James. By looking at the regular season shot chart on the left, it is obvious that LeBron did fantastic in the paint, which shows that his advantage near the basketball still exists. In contrary, he also tried a lot mid range shots and threes but the results was not ideal, except that his shooting percentage on the left corner is extremely high, where by chance Stephen Curry was not good at. Comparing the performance in regular season and playoffs, we could see that although LeBron James still did better than average in the semi-circle area under the basket, his shooting significantly declined in that area. It might be the reason why Lakers in this season did not make it to the finals. Moreover, he still behaved well on the left corner in playoffs than the other one so the defending strategy against LeBron should be opposite to Stephen Curry. 5.3.3 Analysis on shooting behavior in different periods of LeBron James Every basketball game has four periods and athletes would get exhausted when game is getting to the end, so it is important to arrange the rest and the rush hour properly. As we previously discovered in Part 5.1.3, the number of 2-point and 3-point shots are similar in the general league level. However, it is possible that it differs on individual player level. Therefore, let us take a look at the shooting behavior of LeBron James in different periods and hope to find some special patterns in it. Based on the plot, LeBron James prefers attacking the tim to shooting long-distance in the second quarter and among four periods it is last one that he attempted most threes. Therefore, there is one more defending policy against LeBron should be focusing more on his layups in the first half and his threes in the second half. 5.3.4 Shooting Behavior of Giannis Antetokounmpo Giannis Antetokounmpo, AKA Greek Freak, was experiencing his best seasons in past two years. MVP winner, All-star and last but not least, NBA championship. His athleticism is so phenomenol such that he could win all even without good shooting ability. While in the shock by shooting ability of Stephen Curry, let us take a look at Giannis Antetokounmpo, another side of basketball. Based on this alluvial diagram, we could see that Giannis Antetokounmpo in this season spent most his attempts on 2 pointers and two thirds of his shots happened less than 8 feet away from the basket. As a right-handed player, it seems like that he does not have preference on which side to shoot. Moreover, after comparing the shot attempted at left side center and right side center, we could find that he approached the rim more often from the left although he is right-handed. This might be inspirational to his defenders that it is better to focus on his left hand. At last, in his fewer long-distance attempts, he did not very well because we could see more blue flow in the long-distance area. Therefore, he still have a lot of potential to stimulate and there are more accomplishment waiting for him if he could work on his weakness.

[["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion Concluding the Findings From our analysis in chapter 5, we conclude our findings from the shooting pattern for NBA Season 2020-21 as follows: On the general league level, nowadays, basketball tends to shoot fewer mid-range shots - either shooting close to the basket or making more 3-point shots - to try to maximize points per play. Our hypothesis shows that the field goal percentage (whether the goal was made successfully or not) is related to the shooting distance. Teams vary significantly on their choice for making 2-point or 3-point shots. This preference also differs period by period. As the game approaches the 4th period, teams tend to make more 3-point shots compared to their performance in the 1st period. In addition, there is no clear relation between the FG% and the team’s preference for making 2-point or 3-point shots. Players have different personalities in shooting behavior. Stephen Curry’s shooting behavior is a classical example of modern basketball: try less on the mid-range shot and more 2-point shots near the hoop and 3-point shots, and his field goals are mostly above league average. Stephen Curry’s weakness is left corner three. LeBron James did fantastic in the paint (near hoop), and he tried a lot of mid-range shots and threes but the results were not ideal. His shooting percentage on the left corner is extremely high, where Stephen Curry was not good at. Comparing Playoffs to Regular Season, LeBron James still did better than average near the hoop, but his shooting significantly declined in that area. Giannis Antetokounmpo in this season spent most of his attempts on 2-point shots and 2/3 of his shots happened less than 8 feet away from the basket, and he approached the rim more often from the left although he is right-handed. Discussing Limitations Although we discussed shooting behaviors on different levels from broad to detail (from league to team and player), we only focused on the shot features - such as shot time, location, distance, etc. - made by each team and player without other information. However, there are still other considerations. For example, in determining the shooting behaviors of a player, the player demographics (height, weight, etc.) and the position he plays (guard or forward) can also affect the player’s shooting behavior. Also, other considerations such as the defender’s distance from the player can affect the player’s shots. In determining the shooting behaviors of a team, it may heavily rely on the kinds of players in that team and the experience and preference of the coach. These are all aspects that we haven’t included in our project when determining the shooting behaviors. Looking Into the Future With the more advanced visualization tools, analyzing the shooting behavior of a team or player becomes easier, and we can explore more underlying insights by using different ways to visualize the numbers. Considering the limitations we discussed before, there is a wide array of aspects to analyze the NBA shooting data and interpreting strategies of a team or a player. With more NBA data being utilized, we look forward that Exploratory Data Analysis on NBA data may in the future help players or teams to see their weaknesses more easily and make improvements, and even find the opponent’s weaknesses to improve the defence.
